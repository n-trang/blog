"Treat people with kindness" is a phrase popularized by Harry, also is a song in his sophomore album. That's my favourite album. And it's a beautiful phrase.

And do you know that they use "sophomore" to describe the second album. The fist album is called a "debut", and from the third one on they are just called "third", "fourth", etc. That's some English right there.

Anyway, try out the app here: [n-trang.github.io/tpwk]()

## Why

I love Harry Styles. I especially love seeing him performing. And the fandom is very active and gererous. I have always been able to find all of his performances on YouTube. Someone was there and they shared it.

The idea come in using technology to organize and indexing fans' recordings.

    And it's so nice isn't it - when technology and culture come together.

## How

### Externals

- setlist.fm APIs for the set list, time and place
- Fans' videos on YouTube for footage
- youtube.com APIs for searching and indexing

### Front-end

Simple `pwa` app: `html`, `css`, and `javascrip`.

- `html`: very simple, one-page app. I focus on having a clear structure and achive 100% SEO test on `light house`.
- `css`: vanila and light-weight. focus on the basic of padding, specing. using `flaxe` function for mobile-optimized layout.

### Back-end

### Data

### Hosting

### Open-source
